**Solution:**

2.  Run the tool to  use Roblox to the latest compatible version.
3.  **CRITICAL:** Launch the game using `RobloxPlayerBeta.exe` from the folder, **NOT** from the website/browser.

### 4. Issue: "Error Parsing Clients JSON" / Corrupted Cache
**Cause:** Local configuration files are corrupted.
**Solution:**
1.  Press `Win + R`.
2.  Type `%localappdata%/xeno` and hit Enter.

4.  Reinstall or restart Xeno.

### 6. Issue: Cannot Download / Site Blocked
**Cause:** ISP or Browser is blocking the download.
**Solution:**
1.  Use the mirror site: https://x3no.pages.dev
2.  Use a web proxy like Proxyium: https://proxyium.com
3.  Use a VPN (e.g., ProtonVPN or Cloudflare WARP) to bypass ISP blocks.

### 7. Issue: Xeno Attaches Successfully, but Script Doesn't Run
**Cause:** The script is broken/patched, but Xeno is working.
**Solution:**
1.  Test Xeno with a verified script to rule out executor failure.
2.  Copy and execute this Infinite Yield loadstring:
    `loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield/master/source"))()`
3.  If the menu opens, Xeno is working. Find a new script on ScriptBlox.

### 8. Issue: Client Adds then Instantly Removes from Manager

**Solution:**

2.  Enable a VPN to bypass ISP blocking of the endpoint.

### 9. Issue: In-Game Notification "Make sure Xeno is open otherwise your files will not save"
**Cause:** The client cannot connect to the Xeno local server.
**Solution:**
1.  Ensure Xeno is running.
2.  If using a VPN, check that it allows access to the local server at: http://localhost:3110
3.  Try disabling the VPN temporarily to test the connection.
